## Description
In this project we are trying to make a script that, once it takes a DNA input, will see how close the input is to a human! It will also print out what animal, or organism it is if it is not human. 

## How it works!
This program uses Biopython to functions to compare  a FASTA file input by the user to stored FASTA data from the Human genome. 
Through the process of sequence alignment the solver compares the two files against eachother and yields a percentage similarity.
A high match percentage result likely indicates a human sample. A low match percentage generally indicates a non human sample.
After running these functions a result is output indicating if the sample is human or not along with a percentage match to the stored human Genome!
