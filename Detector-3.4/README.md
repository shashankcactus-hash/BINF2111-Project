This is the most up to date version of our genome comparator. 
It compares the human genome to any genome file you put in (note it must be a ".fna.gz" file). 
It utilizes Bio Python to read big genome files and uses local alignment to compare the similarity of the 2 files. 
It now saves all the links you put in in a .json file.
All the results will go to "blastresults.md".
